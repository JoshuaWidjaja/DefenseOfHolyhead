# Excellence Interactive

### Setup

1. Make a new 2D Unity project and name it 'EI'.
2. Go into the new project directory in terminal and do:
	1. git init
	2. git remote add origin https://github.com/xjtn18/EI.git
	3. git pull

All folders aside from 'Assets' and 'ProjectSettings' don't need to be in version control and are in the gitignore.
