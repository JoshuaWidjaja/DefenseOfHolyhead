# Excellence Interactive

### Setup

1. mkdir EI (wherever you want, and thats an 'i', not 'L')
2. cd EI
3. git init
4. git remote add origin https://github.com/xjtn18/EI.git
5. git pull origin master

When that's done, open Unity Hub and click "Add" to add a project directory. Choose the new "EI" directory you created from before. Set Unity Version to 2020.1.6f1

### Notes
All folders aside from 'Assets' and 'ProjectSettings' don't need to be in version control and are in the gitignore.
