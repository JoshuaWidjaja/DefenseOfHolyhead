# Excellence Interactive

### Setup

1. In Unity Hub, make a new 2D project called EI (thats an 'i', not 'L')
2. cd to the new folder that Unity creates and do:
	1. rm -rf Assets && rm -rf ProjectSettings
	2. git init
	3. git remote add origin https://github.com/xjtn18/EI.git
	4. git pull origin master

Set Unity Version to 2020.1.6f1

### Notes
Aside from 'Assets' and 'ProjectSettings', all other folders don't need to be in version control and so are in the gitignore.
