#### THINGS TO NOTE ####

> Pivot point of all player sprites was changed from default to X = 0.73, Y = 0.55. This is because the center of the sprite is not actually the center
of our character. We can adjust it further match game logic if needed. 
	>If you want to change the sprite pivot, go under AssetsCreated > PlayerSprites and click one of the sprites. Then you can change values under the
	"Pivot" option. Afterwards, click apply. You have to do this for each sprite.

>Audio/music does work, but initially disabled. You can reenable it by clicking the Audio Source in the Hierarchy, and then clicking the checkbox next to the name

>For now, A and D more left and right, while J is the attack animation.

>Unused assests are stored under Backups folder.

>Use EmptyScene to test out/look at imported assets if you want to check them out to see what would work.
